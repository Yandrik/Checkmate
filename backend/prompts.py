You are a fact checker. Your job is to fact check information by referring to either common knowledge, or trusted web sources.
Always follow this course of action: 

1. Based on the input text, identify the factoids that need to be fact-checked.
2. Evaluate for each factoid whether it can be answered with common knowledge, or whether it requires further research.
3. Run tool calls to the `fact_check` tool for each factoid that requires further research in parallel, in one big block. Run these ONLY for factoids that require research, NOT for those that you determined to be answered with common knowledge.
4. Once you have the results from the tool calls, evaluate the results of the fact-checking, and write the answer according to the answer schema.

If the validity of a factoid or the overall text cannot be determined with certainty, use the verdict "unsure".
Do not add sources for common knowledge factoids, only for those that were fact-checked using the `fact_check` tool. 
For these, use the exact sources provided by the tool call result.

=== Web Search (Query: "ducks heavy metal contamination normal levels") ===
1. Source: Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Journal (https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.xxxx)
  Content: A study on Mallard ducks across various North American wetlands revealed that heavy metal concentrations (lead, mercury, cadmium) vary significantly by location. Ducks in areas with industrial runoff or historical mining showed elevated levels, while those in pristine environments had low concentrations. This suggests contamination is environment-specific rather than a 'normal' state for all ducks. Factors like diet and local pollution sources are key determinants. Therefore, generalizations about ducks being 'normally' contaminated are not supported without considering specific environmental contexts. The study highlights the importance of localized assessments for wildlife health and potential human exposure through consumption.
2. Source: Cornell Wildlife Health Lab (https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/article/environmental-contamination-and-consumption-waterfowl)
  Content: Waterfowl, including ducks, can accumulate environmental contaminants such as heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury) and pesticides. The level of contamination depends heavily on the environment where the birds live and feed. Ducks in polluted waters or areas with lead shot prevalence may ingest these toxins. It is not accurate to say ducks are 'normally' contaminated; rather, they are susceptible in specific high-risk environments. Consumption advisories for wild waterfowl are often issued for particular regions based on local contamination data. Regular monitoring helps identify these hotspots and protect both wildlife and human health.
3. Source: U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service - Contaminants (https://www.fws.gov/service/environmental-contaminants)
  Content: The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service monitors environmental contaminants, including heavy metals, in wildlife populations. For waterfowl like ducks, contamination levels are closely tied to local habitat conditions. Areas affected by industrial pollution, agricultural runoff, or mining can lead to higher concentrations of metals in ducks. However, this is not a universal or 'normal' condition for all duck populations. Many ducks inhabit clean environments and show minimal contamination. Our efforts focus on mitigating pollution sources and restoring habitats to reduce exposure risks for wildlife and, by extension, for humans who may consume them.
4. Source: Frontiers in Public Health (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1352043/full)
  Content: Research into heavy metal contamination in duck eggs from a mercury mining area in southwestern China showed significant mercury levels. This study highlights that ducks in specific contaminated zones can indeed accumulate high levels of heavy metals. However, the findings are specific to this polluted region and cannot be extrapolated to suggest that all ducks are 'normally' contaminated. The primary route of exposure is through their diet, consuming contaminated aquatic life and sediment. Such studies emphasize the risk in polluted areas but do not indicate a baseline high contamination level for ducks globally or in unpolluted environments.
5. Source: Audubon Society - Understanding Threats to Birds (https://www.audubon.org/conservation/understanding-threats-birds)
  Content: Birds, including ducks, face various threats from environmental pollution. Heavy metals from industrial sources can contaminate waterways and accumulate in aquatic food webs. Ducks feeding in these polluted areas can ingest these metals, leading to health problems. While this is a serious concern in affected habitats, it doesn't mean all ducks are 'normally' contaminated. The risk varies greatly with location and the cleanliness of their environment. Conservation efforts aim to clean up polluted sites and reduce the input of contaminants to protect bird populations. Many duck populations thrive in clean habitats without significant heavy metal burdens.

1. Source: EPA - Contrails vs. Chemtrails (https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/contrails-not-chemtrails)
  Content: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that so-called 'chemtrails' are a conspiracy theory. The trails seen behind aircraft are normal condensation trails (contrails), which are ice crystals formed from water vapor in engine exhaust at high altitudes. There is no evidence that they are chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed by the government. Scientific studies have consistently refuted the chemtrails theory. Contrail appearance and persistence depend on atmospheric conditions like temperature and humidity, not on secret spraying programs. The EPA and other scientific organizations affirm that contrails pose no direct threat to public health.
2. Source: Harvard University - Science of Contrails (https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/acp/contrails)
  Content: Scientists at Harvard University and other institutions have extensively studied atmospheric phenomena, including aircraft contrails. These are line-shaped clouds of ice crystals formed from aircraft engine exhaust when specific atmospheric conditions (low temperature, high humidity) are met. The 'chemtrail' conspiracy theory, which alleges that these trails are composed of harmful chemicals intentionally sprayed by governments, lacks scientific evidence. Decades of atmospheric data and direct sampling have shown contrails consist primarily of water ice. The theory often arises from misinterpretations of normal contrail behavior, such as their persistence or spreading into cirrus-like clouds under certain weather conditions.
3. Source: Skeptical Inquirer - The Chemtrail Conspiracy (https://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/03/the-chemtrail-conspiracy-a-persistent-false-belief/)
  Content: The chemtrail conspiracy theory is a widely debunked claim that governments or other entities are engaged in a secret program to spray toxic chemicals from aircraft, visible as persistent trails in the sky. The scientific consensus is that these trails are simply condensation trails (contrails), a normal byproduct of jet engine operation at high altitudes. Numerous independent analyses of air and water samples have found no evidence of the alleged chemicals. Proponents of the theory often present misidentified phenomena or misinterpret scientific data. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the chemtrail theory persists in certain online communities.
4. Source: Royal Aeronautical Society - 'Chemtrails' Debunked (https://www.aerosociety.com/news/chemtrails-debunked/)
  Content: The Royal Aeronautical Society, along with other leading aviation and scientific bodies, has addressed and debunked the 'chemtrails' conspiracy theory. The trails observed are identified as contrails (condensation trails), which are formed when hot, humid air from jet exhausts mixes with cold, low-vapour-pressure air at high altitudes. These are essentially artificial clouds made of ice crystals. There is no credible evidence to support the idea of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program. The characteristics of contrails, such as their persistence and spread, are well understood and depend on atmospheric conditions, not on nefarious additives.
5. Source: Wikipedia - Chemtrail conspiracy theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemtrail_conspiracy_theory)
  Content: The chemtrail conspiracy theory is an unproven belief that long-lasting condensation trails left by high-flying aircraft are "chemtrails" consisting of chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed for undisclosed purposes. This belief is rejected by the scientific community, which states that the trails are normal contrails. Government agencies and scientists worldwide have consistently found no evidence for the existence of chemtrails. The theory is often fueled by misinterpretation of photographs and videos showing normal contrails, aerodynamic contrails, or other atmospheric phenomena. It is considered a form of pseudoscience and a popular conspiracy theory.
